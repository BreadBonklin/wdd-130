    <h2>Bread Bonklin</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! I'm Brett Conklin! I am from a small town in Virginia, 
        but I'm about 20 min outside Washington DC. So I just tell people 
        I am from DC. 
    </p>

    <p>I am a sophomore here at BYU-I and I am a Web Development Major. 
        I have big hopes of working in UI and UX capacities in the future!
    </p>

    <p>I served my mission in Guadalajara Mexico asi que hablo espanol!
    </p>

    <p>I have taken some of Web development in the past, however I got sick 
        during the semester and felt I needed to retake the class to genuninely 
        learn the content, so here I am!
    </p>

    <p>I love that in tech, you have to stay relevant and up to date, 
        especially as a developer. I like that it is constant learning and 
        updating skills that you already have.
    </p>
